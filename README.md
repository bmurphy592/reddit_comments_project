# Setup

Numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn are required for this project. 
The whole stack can be installed this way (I think):

	pip install -U numpy scipy scikit-learn

The data for this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/reddit-comments-may-2015/data .
You'll need to download this yourself as adding it to git would take forever.
Your ultimate directory structure should look like:

	code/
		- reg.py
	data/
		-database.sqlite
	README.md
